This is the first version. Seems to work, but I haven't tested it
heavily, yet.

Right now it sorts the entire directory listing at once. I'm
considering changing that to do an incremental sort. If it were common
for programs to request partial directory listings, that would
probably be a safe bet.  But since most of them seem to read
everything in (so they can sort it; sigh), we're probably better
off sticking with the more efficient sort.

Pull requests for bug fixes appreciated; pull requests to turn it into
something fancier are less appreciated.
