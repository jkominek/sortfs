This is the first version. There appear to be some subtle problems with
it, and I no longer have a need for it. Consider yourself free to fork
and take over maintenance if it is of use to you.

Right now it sorts the entire directory listing at once. I'm
considering changing that to do an incremental sort. If it were common
for programs to request partial directory listings, that would
probably be a safe bet.  But since most of them seem to read
everything in (so they can sort it; sigh), we're probably better
off sticking with the more efficient sort.
